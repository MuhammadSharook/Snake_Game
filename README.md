# Snake_Game Project
-> The only technology used for making the Snake game is Java Swing library, which provides lightweight components for making window-based applications.

-> The functionalities of the game are controlling the snake using key buttons, making it eat food, increasing the snake's size and scores, and ending the game when the snake collides with obstacles.
